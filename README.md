# ZeroLimits.dev

The ZeroLimits.dev homepage

## Build instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/noClaps/ZeroLimits.dev.git
    cd ZeroLimits.dev
    ```

2.  Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) if you don't have it already, and start the development server.
    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

3.  Build the site. If you've already run `make dev`, then this command has already been run, and you can simply access the files from the `dist/` directory.
    ```sh
    make build
    ```
    This will place the built files in the `dist/` directory.
